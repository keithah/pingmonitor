# Privacy Policy for PingScope - Stay Connected!

**Last Updated:** September 17, 2024

## Overview

PingScope - Stay Connected! ("PingScope", "we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our macOS application handles information when you use our network monitoring service.

## Information We Do NOT Collect

**PingScope is designed with privacy in mind. We do not collect, store, transmit, or process any personal information.**

Specifically, we do NOT collect:
- Personal identification information (name, email, phone number, etc.)
- Device identifiers or unique device information
- Location data or IP addresses
- Usage analytics or telemetry data
- Crash reports or diagnostic information
- Network traffic content or sensitive data
- Any data that could identify you personally

## What PingScope Does

PingScope is a network monitoring tool that:
- **Monitors network connectivity** to hosts you specify (Google DNS, Cloudflare, your router, etc.)
- **Displays real-time ping results** in your menu bar and application interface
- **Stores ping history locally** on your device for your reference
- **Exports monitoring data** in CSV, JSON, or text formats when you choose to do so

## Data Storage and Processing

### Local Data Only
- **All data stays on your device:** Ping history, settings, and configurations are stored locally on your Mac
- **No cloud synchronization:** We do not sync your data to any external servers
- **No remote servers:** PingScope does not communicate with our servers or any third-party analytics services

### Network Monitoring
- **Host connectivity only:** PingScope only checks if specified hosts are reachable
- **No content monitoring:** We do not monitor, store, or analyze the content of your network traffic
- **Standard network protocols:** Uses TCP, UDP, and ICMP protocols for connectivity testing only

## App Sandbox and Security

PingScope operates within Apple's App Sandbox environment, which:
- **Restricts data access** to only what's necessary for network monitoring
- **Prevents unauthorized data collection** through system-level protections
- **Ensures data isolation** from other applications
- **Limits network access** to ping operations only

## Data Export

When you use PingScope's export feature:
- **You control the data:** Export is initiated only by you
- **Local files only:** Exported data is saved to locations you choose on your device
- **No automatic sharing:** We never automatically share or upload your monitoring data

## Children's Privacy

PingScope does not collect any information from users of any age. The app is suitable for all ages as it operates entirely locally and does not process personal information.

## Third-Party Services

PingScope does not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or data collection services. The app operates independently without external dependencies that could compromise your privacy.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the "Last Updated" date above. Since PingScope does not collect any personal information, policy changes will typically relate to clarifications or additional privacy protections.

## Data Deletion

Since all data is stored locally on your device:
- **Uninstalling PingScope** removes all associated data
- **You can delete data** by removing the application
- **We cannot access your data** to delete it remotely, as we never receive it

**Summary:** PingScope - Stay Connected! is a privacy-focused network monitoring tool that keeps all your data local, doesn't collect personal information, and operates within Apple's secure App Sandbox environment. Your privacy is protected by design.
